## motivation
Getting menus on restaurant-websites that can be filtered for things like allergens and animal products, and once we are there make restaurant websites accessible and responsive.

## conceptual thoughts
* Building a template that newbie-web-developers can use, as an open source project and possibly making a tutorial for it.
* Decentralized, each restaurant website that uses it is their own project.

## what would one filter for?
That depends what the restaurant is offering. For someone who is selling ice-cream and all their items are vegetarian already, there is no point in filtering vor ‘vegetarian’. Filter for aspects where some of your dishes has it and others don’t. Recommended are vegetarian, vegan and some of the most common food allergies/intolerances (dairy, eggs, nuts, peanuts, gluten-containing grains, seafood, soy). Obviously this can be made as complicated as one wishes, what makes sense depends in the profile of the restaurant.

### the ‘maybes’
Some dishes can be made vegetarian. Some dishes can be served without the peanut-topping or without the bread. Some drinks can be made non-alcoholic. Let’s have three possibilities: 
* ’x’-included
* ‘x’-free
* can be made without ‘x’

## technology used 
html, CSS/SASS, jQuery

## needed/to-do
* a look, start SASS
* an English name
* a logo (what could be a good symbol?) 
* a map with
1. restaurants that have such a menu on their website (where ever the software comes from, I wouldn’t restrict it to a specific solution)
2. restaurants that want such a menu in their website
3. professional web-developers and web-developers in training who would like to make restaurant websites where one can filter the menu
* tutorials

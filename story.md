* new idea to bring together a couple of things

* people want to learn web development (codebar)
** work in teams
** have a real customer
** build something they can showcase later
* but is too much hassle acquiring real customers

* then I got inspired by Allergikercafé in Vienna
* how about, if you go to a restaurant website, you can click “but I can’t have peanuts”, and the menu is shown without the peanut-containing dishes? :)
* I think that that is a good project idea for a couple of reasons.
** restaurant websites are often very bad and there isn’t much money in independent gastronomy anyway, so I would guess that there are many restaurant-websites would be happy to get an update and it can be made by a webdevelopement-student. there are also many restaurants, so even if only 1% of restaurants in your city want to have a new or updated website, it will be possible to find something.
** there is an increasing number of people with specific dietary habits like vegetarians, vegans and people with allergies, so there is an actual demand for it, and they can also urge their favorite restaurants to get a menu that can be filtered for certain ingredients.

* there are many things to consider here 
* I’m thinking about something like a template that webdevelopers-in-the-learning can use to make restaurant websites where the menu can be filtered for allergies.
* apart from the people who eat in the restaurant and use the website, there are three kinds of people involved: the people who write the template, people who build the restaurant websites that use the template, and the restaurant owners, who should be able to edit the menu without calling the webmaster.

* what would one filter for? that depends on what the restaurant sells. for instance if you sell ice cream, you most likely have only vegetarian products anyway and therefore there is no point to filter for ‘vegetarian’. you could for instance filter vor ‘vegan’ (if you have vegan and non-vegan products) and ‘nuts’
* maybes. some dishes can be made vegetarian. and for instance in Vietnamese cuisine there is often a peanut topping and the dish can easily be made without. so, for each dish and each ingredient it can have three situations, ‘Yes’, ‘no’ and ‘can be made without’. 
* so this is an imaginary ice cream place. …
* obviously this is a very short list of things but you get the idea with the three states, and it also shows a main reason why I would make the whole thing decentralized, ultimately I can’t tell a restaurant whether or not a cappuccino can be made vegan, that is up to their profile and their decision. 

* currently: codebar hackathon with frontend und backend students and coaches and a graphics person,
* need: 
** (English)name, 
** possibly logo (what could be a good symbol?) 
** software architecture decisions
** a backlog of less urgent wishes like being able to operate with a screenreader since it is also a project for teaching future web developers and it would be good if they learn about accessibility and other good practices

* is there money involved? not yet but there can and should be webdevelopers who make restaurent websites with allergiker-karte for money -> bsd-like license

* I’d go for market penetration here, basically I am a picky eater too and want to be able to shorten restaurant menus so I don’t need to be able to read all the things I don’t want to eat anyway.
* what am I going to do? coordinate stuff and put my face in front of the camera. 
* but I also want it to be decentralized. in the end I only want to have 
** a github repo, 
** maybe a couple of tutorials how to use or implement the allergikerkarte as a webdeveloper and how to change menu items as a restaurant owner and 
** a map with restaurants that have allergikerkarte and 
** a way for restaurant owners and webdevelopers to find each others and there can be different categories for webdevelopement-students and webdevelopers who make it for money.

* so, I’ll make a github repo with ideas now and post it in the shownotes and I’m looking forwards to hearing from you
